# Image-Classification-Model-on-Fashion-MNIST

This project implements an image classification model on the Fashion MNIST dataset using a neural network. The dataset consists of grayscale images of clothing items categorized into 10 classes.

## Features
- Preprocessing: Normalization of pixel values (scaling from 0 to 1)
- Model Training: Neural network implemented using TensorFlow/Keras
- Evaluation: Performance metrics like accuracy and loss
- Visualization: Training progress plots and sample predictions

## Dataset
The Fashion MNIST dataset contains 70,000 images (60,000 for training, 10,000 for testing) with 10 classes:
- T-shirt/top
- Trouser
- Pullover
- Dress
- Coat
- Sandal
- Shirt
- Sneaker
- Bag
- Ankle boot

## Installation
To run this project, install the necessary dependencies:
```bash
pip install tensorflow numpy matplotlib
```

## Usage
Run the notebook in Google Colab or locally:
```bash
jupyter notebook Image_classification_model_on_Fashion_MNIST.ipynb
```

## Results
The model achieves a reasonable accuracy in classifying fashion items, with visualizations provided for training progress and sample predictions.
